# GDB-Server-for-STM32
An example gdb server for both host and target project

This code is NOT completed. It is just for demonstration purposes. Both host and target code still has bugs. Please be aware of it.
Feel free to use, copy, redistribute and alter my code.

Most of the functionality of the target code is implemented in stm32f7xx_it.c, debug.c, and main.c.
